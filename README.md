### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

###### My name is Xavier and soon to be graduate at General ASsembly. In a little over two weeks, I would have completed the Software Immersive program. I am a full MERN stack Junior developer and I'm hungry to learn a lot more.

Currently I am learning the MERN stack to create React applications. I really want to learn C as that was the first programming language I dabbled in (arduinos use c as well). I know a little bit about hardware and i would love to bridge software and hardware on my own. Ideally I want to build physical items for my personal use. The ability tp program my own smart home will be nice dream to acheive as well.
